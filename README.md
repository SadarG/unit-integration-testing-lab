## Project Description
This lab demonstrates **unit and integration testing** using Python's `pytest` framework for a sample Banking System.  
The system includes:

- `deposit(balance, amount)`  
- `withdraw(balance, amount)`  
- `transfer(balance_from, balance_to, amount)`

All functions include proper **error handling** to ensure robust operations.  
Unit tests verify **correct functionality**, and integration tests validate **combined operations**.  
Additionally, HTML test reports are generated using `pytest-html` for easier review.
